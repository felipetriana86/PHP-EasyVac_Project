						You can see Toronto from eye level on the street. You can climb the famous CN Tower to see it from above. You can even take a boat ride around the waterfront. But nowhere else can you experience a view of Toronto from the sky like this one, on board a helicopter flying high above the largest city in Canada. It�s the perfect idea for a honeymoon, marriage proposal or any special occasion. Begin this Toronto helicopter tour at the Toronto City Center Airport, located downtown, just minutes west of the shoreline from the CN Tower. The Jewel flight is the showcase flight of downtown Toronto. This tour takes place at 2,000 feet (609 meters), covering nine miles (14 km). Marvel at the sights from this height and the distance that can be traveled without battling with the congested streets and traffic lights below. Discover Toronto by flying over the Canadian National Exhibition grounds in the west to the Don Valley Parkway in the east, and from the Lake Shore in the south up to Bloor Street in the north. This flight includes two framed photographs to commemorate the trip. The Interlude flight features the same highlights as the Jewel with some extra niceties. In addition to the two framed photographs, enjoy wine or champagne, desserts, and souvenirs. The flight travels farther west to Humber Bay and High Park, then north to St. Clair Avenue and east to Casa Loma before heading back downtown � covering 14 miles (23 km).

					<p style="color:#009999;font-size:20px;margin:30px">
						Start with pickup from Banff and travel in a modern minibus along the Bow Valley Parkway to the Canyon. On arrival at the Johnston Canyon trailhead, your guide will show you how to put on ice cleats over your winter boots, as well as give you some tips on winter hiking. From here, start the moderate 2.7 kilometer hike with 135 meter elevation to the Upper Falls. Walk along the steel catwalks built into the canyon walls which allows a spectacular view down the canyon walls to the ice and river below. Along the way you'll learn the clues to how Johnston Canyon was formed and stop at the Lower Falls, where you'll have the option to walk through a natural cave feature for a unique view. At the Upper Falls, enjoy a brief stop on the upper deck with a small refreshment break to enjoy the views. These gigantic pillars of ice are the tour highlight and ice climbers can often be seen scaling the frozen columns. Once you've finished your hot chocolate, hike back down and your guide will transport you back to Banff and drop you at your hotel.
